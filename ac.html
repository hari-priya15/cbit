        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p class="intropara">
            The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with
             a motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using 
             traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation,
              or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.
              Before the introduction of digital production, series of still images were recorded 
              on a strip of chemically sensitized celluloid (photographic film stock), usually at 
              the rate of 24 frames per second. The images are transmitted through a movie
               projector at the same rate as they were recorded, with a Geneva drive ensuring that 
               each frame remains still during its short projection time. A rotating shutter causes 
               stroboscopic intervals of darkness, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions 
               due to flicker fusion. The apparent motion on the screen is the result of the fact that
                the visual sense cannot discern the individual images at high speeds, so the impressions
                of the images blend with the dark intervals and are thus linked together to produce the
                 illusion of one moving image.
        </p>

            The name "film" originally referred to the thin layer of photochemical emulsion on the celluloid strip 
            that used to be the actual medium for recording and displaying motion pictures.
             Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including "picture", "picture show",
              "moving picture", "photoplay", and "flick". The most common term in the United States is "movie",
               while in Europe "film" is preferred. Archaic terms include "animated pictures" and "animated photography".
            "Flick" is in general a slang term, first recorded in 1926. It originates in the verb flicker,
             owing to the flickering appearance of early films.
             Common terms for the field in general include "the big screen", "the silver screen", "the movies",
             and "cinema"; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays.
              In early years, the word "sheet" was sometimes used instead of "screen".
